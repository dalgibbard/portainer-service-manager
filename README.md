# portainer-service-manager
Crappy web app to easily start/stop portainer stacks

## TODO
* Load the list of stacks from the API
* Load the current Stack status from the API and enable/disable the start/stop button as needed (or better yet, some state text + one button to toggle it; and hide the button when a task is in progress)
* Make pretty
